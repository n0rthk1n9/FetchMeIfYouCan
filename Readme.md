# Fetch Me If You Can

**Because who needs a pilot’s license when you have URLSession**

## Overview

Ever stared at an API and thought, “Ugh, how do I even start?” This workshop is your solution! In a 1-hour follow-along session, you'll learn to build a clean, repeatable pattern for calling any JSON API in Swift—using only native tools:

- **async/await**
- **URLSession**
- **Codable**

No Alamofire. No third-party libraries. Just pure Swift you can copy, tweak, and use in any project starting today.

## What You'll Build

We'll break the project into three clear steps, each in its own branch:

1. **Step 1:** A simple GET request to fetch data.
2. **Step 2:** Enhance the GET with a search feature.
3. **Step 3:** Build a robust architecture and supply SwiftUI previews with mock data.

- **`main`**: Contains the project skeleton.
- **`step-1`**: Simple GET request.
- **`step-2`**: GET with search functionality.
- **`step-3`**: Final architecture with proper previews.
